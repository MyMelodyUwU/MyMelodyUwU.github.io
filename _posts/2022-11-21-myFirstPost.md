### What do I want to learn @ SPond

I want to be a cloud infrastructure guru who can create systems for everyone to use!

### Security -> Finding Researchers and the blogs

#### MangoPDF

The first person I will nominate is a person I had met overtime, 
[Alex/MangoPDF](https://mango.pdf.zone/). 
Other than his blogs being funny, he describes the "Over Securing" 
of material and aspects of security through obsecurity. 

#### John Hammond (Not really a blogger, more of a Youtuber)

[John](https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnHammond010/) not only taught me
 how to do my first set of CTFs, but John had really funny
 documentaries about the dark web. This being one of my favorite 
[moments](https://youtu.be/iP5C5LLhHMQ?t=411)

#### Minh 

[Minh](https://whitehoodhacker.net/posts/2021-10-04-the-big-rick) 
managed to rick roll his whole district. 
This is his blog and this is a [DEFCON Talk]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PAauAy-Fb4) about it. 

#### For fun Projects

http://www.phrack.org/

Could we do something from Phrack? ^ 

### CLI tools cheat sheets.

### VIM keybindings cheat sheet

I learnt how to setup my vim setup using keybindings and a website
tutorial!

This is my vimrc!

```
syntax on
set tabstop=4
set colorcolumn=70
set shiftwidth=4
set scrolloff=10
filetype on
```

### Using a different device 

Today, I also have learnt to setup my SSH keys on different devices
this is a big example! I can now use a preferred IDE with my own settings,
and I can push / deploy using WSL2

### Making up Github Pages with Ruby (Jekyll)

1) I installed relevant packges for Ruby / RubyGems to init the website's fundermentals (I have made a mistake, which was installing the packages as / ). This includes building natives extensions to the program. I did run into a problem of version compatability as well. 
2) I have setup a repo for use, this can be found [here](https://github.com/MyMelodyUwU/jekyllBasedBlog.git)
3) When I read tutorials, I need to optimize my work towards the tutorial. I understand what instructions are needed on my system. 
4) A big lesson that I have learnt is that I have to optimise my systems towards requirement goals. This will mean having the right environement. 

### CLI tools cheat sheets.

https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh.git

Cheat.sh is very accessible. It also does not take too much memory space. Will need an internet connection. Potentially the Cheat.sh material can be vague. 
Cheat.sh may not be as effective on non unix like OS since man pages exist. 

### VIM Cheat sheets + Pro Points

1) Shows the effect of using capital letter in Visual mode. I normally just use the lowercase letters.
2) Use of shortcuts that does not need to need command mode (I learnt that ZZ is more faster than using :wq) 

I defs do not use captial letters when using vim. I shall start to.

3) Use of Registers, did not know that existed. 
4) Advanced searching. I only know how to use / to search. 

The 2nd cheat sheet is a bit hard to see, when I am more confident w VIM I will learn

5) This cheat sheet has a lot of emphasis of moving by line rather than using the jk keys to move up and down 
6) emphasis of REGEX in my searching
7) Use of find and replace features. 
8) Given commands to follow to rinse and repeat into mind.

1) Describes the order of the code, where it goes and the order when using it in a CLI Interface. 
2) Lacks information/flexbility of the commands
