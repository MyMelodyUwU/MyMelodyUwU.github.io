### What do I want to learn @ SPond

I want to be a cloud infrastructure guru who can create systems for everyone to use!

### Security -> Finding Researchers and the blogs

#### MangoPDF

The first person I will nominate is a person I had met overtime, 
[Alex/MangoPDF](https://mango.pdf.zone/). 
Other than his blogs being funny, he describes the "Over Securing" 
of material and aspects of security through obsecurity. 

#### John Hammond (Not really a blogger, more of a Youtuber)

[John](https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnHammond010/) not only taught me
 how to do my first set of CTFs, but John had really funny
 documentaries about the dark web. This being one of my favorite 
[moments](https://youtu.be/iP5C5LLhHMQ?t=411)

#### Minh 

[Minh](https://whitehoodhacker.net/posts/2021-10-04-the-big-rick) 
managed to rick roll his whole district. 
This is his blog and this is a [DEFCON Talk]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PAauAy-Fb4) about it. 

#### For fun Projects

http://www.phrack.org/

Could we do something from Phrack? ^

### VIM keybindings cheat sheet

I learnt how to setup my vim setup using keybindings and a website
tutorial!

This is my vimrc!

```
syntax on
set tabstop=4
set colorcolumn=70
set shiftwidth=4
set scrolloff=10
filetype on
```

### Hi

Today, I also have learnt to setup my SSH keys on different devices
this is a big example! I can now use a preferred IDE with my own settings,
and I can push / deploy using WSL2

Whoo hoo!
