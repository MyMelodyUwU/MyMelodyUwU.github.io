### What I managed to do before meetings:

1) Setup python env
2) Interpret my script, which a GET request could be made on the machine locally and from my own laptop. 

### I aim to today without my supervisor: 

1) Port Forward the Web server from the other machine to my local machine.  


### Attempting to make communication between my local machine and a machine elsewhere:

From the machine elsewhere, I managed to ping Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)

#### Finding the IP Address:

I managed to find the IP Address by DIGGING the DNS.

I had tried pinging my local machine from the machine elsewhere . No success.

There is a speculation that the machine I am looking at may have DDOS protection. 


### Attempting to use the Machine as a resource monitor, sending information to my local machine:

### Extra refactoring with andy!

There is now a todo list now on the monitor program. Unfortunatly, my code does not push to GIT. I have taken a look at it and I am not sure why. 

I will need Andy to look @ it.
