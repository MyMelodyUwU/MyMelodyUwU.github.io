## Turing completness

I think this [offline book game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SiUnqMJEVU) is turing complete!

This is because a set of rules and instructions are being put into play. All the user has to do is feed the inputs in (What pages to flip)

## Git lab

What is GitLab: 

Kaban board, issue tracker, a place to push and commit to onto to deploy a product, which can be easily revertable and issues can be tracked and managed!

I'm currently Given an issue, which I have been assigned to.

### Linting -> Safety

There is also Linting, which helps reduce errors and ensure that the application is securly developed in the system. Linting ensures that common errors in code are avoided. 

### What is an Epic? 

An epic is a user story which describe user actions long term. In my case, the Epic describes the user monitoring the system resources. This website gives an example of an epic [here](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics) 


## What are queues again

Gernal way to resolve conflicts

flexible. 

consuming more memory

Transfer multiple threads to a single thread to prevent issues

## A nice thing todo using smoothness in randomness of temperatures

I managed to do a mock of the smoothness in RNG, which I could create a uniform distribution using RUNIF in R. Because it is a different language, I had to try transcribe it to Python. Here it is anyway.

## Creating realistic data

What can I do:

1) I can call from an API [here](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/australian-bureau-meteorology-rest-api)

2) I couild have physical sensors in my home

3) I could physically hold a thermo and type it in the computer every hour! (This is very useless)

## What is my project

### So what is my project?

I am trying to implement in Silverponds current product a Resource monitoring unit which will tell the temperatures, disk space, etc of the machine. This will hopefully provide insight and resource management to prevent major hardware issues. This will hopefully also provide an indicator of resourcing issues in the system. 

### Goals of this

1) To ship a feature onto the system

2) For exposure to the cloud industry

3) To see a Technical product being made and the flow of it in the industry. 

## Technical Debt and my Project

It seems like the technical debt is a bit higher as I did not think about how the temperatures are made within a uniform distribution to create realistic data. 

What I have tried was creating a function to hold the temperatures. But, it came to my notice that I have multiple locations, which deems this idea non-feasible. This would only work if I had only 1 location to work with (I.e. Sydney). Therefore this idea had to be scrapped. 

This is also out of scope since the scope of the project has changed.
