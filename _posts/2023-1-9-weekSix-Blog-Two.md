## New year in SaaS 

The new year in SaaS provides 4 major issues, which this [article](
https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/top-saas-cybersecurity-threats-in-2023.html) discusses about: 

### Web App weaknesses:

Probably the worst of them all considering the Optus databreach. In application to web application, the [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) is a common way to find 10 exploits. There are further web development security vulnerabilities, which can be found [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/)

### Misconfiguration Mistakes:

This is where I want to follow up on, I want to learn to configure IaaS products, which defintly want to learn to keep my own material secure. This might need extensive time and care onto. 

### Vuln Software and patching:

Need of constant review and auditing of code/infrastructure. Vulnerabilities in the software will need extensive risk monitoring.  

### Policies and practices:

This issue was basically my placements, since there was a theoretical issue, the practical IaaS had many issues. I think if gov agencies learnt to inject money and use it wisely in IT, a lot of issues can be resolved.  

## Forgetting everything and needing to run my resource monitor on another machine!

It seems like my server was down this morning, this meant I had to clone my repo and run it again!

Luckily, I had pushed my work from yesterday! Phew! This meant I could just clone my repo and get going again! 

I had forgotten to setup the repo, just like before, so luckily, I had detailed instructions, that even for a monkey like me could understand if I had forgotten!

## Sqlite db issue this morning:

^^ Me Learning SQLite and figuring out there was an issue on the way i appened items to the db. This will be looked at soon. 

The repo will need to be heavily cleaned up as well.
