Pycache is a directory made when modules are imported in python scripts. This checks if theres a compiled version of the module already. 

Pycache is usually located in the same directory as the source code file for the imported module. 

### What is gitignore

gitignore is a file that is used to specify patterns for files and directories that should be excluded from version control in a Git repository.
